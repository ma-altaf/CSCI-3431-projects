# CSCI-3431-projects

Projects done during the university course CSCI 3431 (operating system), we were given a project description and guide to code the 2 projects.

## Project 1

In this project we wrote a program to get the median in an unordered list using the distributed median finding algorithm.

In this project we wrote a program to find the shortest distance between 2 points usng the Floyd-Warshall (FW) All-Pairs-Shortest-Path algorithm. we implemented it in single threaded and multi-threaded.
